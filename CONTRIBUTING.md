## Setting up a local instance for development
1. Create a fork of this repository.
2. We'll use Vercel to deploy our Next.js application, so go ahead and import the repository from Github to a new Vercel project, selecting the framework preset as "Next.js" if it isn't already.
3. Leave all of the build & output settings as they are. However, there are several Environmental Variables **required** for the site to function:

| Name                     | Description                                                                                             | Usage                |

4. Click "Deploy" and verify that everything builds correctly. You should now be able to visit your deployed frontend.

> Be patient, Next.js takes about a minute to build and deploy, so committed changes might not show up immediately. You can check on the status of deployments in the Vercel dashboard.

Depending on how you choose to host your MongoDB database, you may have a slightly different setup process, but we will be using MongoDB Atlas for our data storage.

5. From the MongoDB Atlas UI, start a new project. Name and members don't matter.
6. Create a new database (cluster), choose the setup options that make sense for your location and budget.
7. Within your new cluster, you will need to create a new database. Name this database `data` and the initial collection `users`.
8. Insert a new document into the `users` collection with this schema:

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId(/*default value*/),
  username: "foo",
  email: ""
}
```
>The `_id` property will populate with a default value when you create the new document. Leave this value as it is.

What this document does is give the database something to work with when logging in or creating users. You shouldn't need to initialize any of the other collections.

9. Still in the `users` collection, navigate to the "indexes" tab in the Atlas UI. Create a new index with these inputs:

Fields:
```js
{
  email: 1
}
```
Options:
```js
{
  unique: true
}
```

10. Go back to your deployment's frontend and check that creating a new account works! Make sure to put an email in the field, or you will get an error initially. (This resolves itself after the first account is created, so email can be optional after that.)

_After creating a user you should be able to change `permissions.admin` to `true` for your user via Atlas to gain full access to the admin features._

#### Now that you've finished setup, you can delete the "foo" user and start developing locally! ðŸ¥³
