## What is TrackTask?
TrackTask is a shareable task management platform. Users can create tasks with names, descriptions, due dates, etc. and keep track of their completion & priority.
Additionally, tasks can be grouped in collections, which can be shared with other users and modified by them if they have the right permissions. [Learn more](https://tracktask.eu.org/about)

## Where is it?
TrackTask is a browser-based web app that can be accessed at https://tracktask.eu.org. We've done our best to ensure support for all major web browsers, including ease of use on mobile devices.

## Things to consider:
> This project is **still in development**, some things may be incomplete or not work as expected. We're working on adding features and improving existing infrastructure, but most of us have other commitments such as school, so we can't always devote our attention to this project.

> If you find something that you dislike and/or think could be better, **please don't just complain** about it. Sometimes we miss things, but most times we'd like to know _how_ we can improve things, so complaining about them won't always get you (or us) anywhere.

> The code you see here is the product of **hundreds of hours of work and improvement**. We are very proud of how far we've come since development on TrackTask first started nearly a year ago. The truth is, this project was created to satisfy a single person's need to keep track of school assignments, but it's grown to be much more; a worthwhile learning experience, a result that hopefully a few others will continue to find useful for many years to come.
