### An open-source task management platform geared towards organized collaboration.
This repository contains our source code as well as our development roadmap for features and updates. Found an issue or want to make an improvement? Leave us an issue or pull request!

## What is TrackTask?
TrackTask is a shareable task management platform. Users can create tasks with names, descriptions, due dates, etc. and keep track of their completion & priority.
Additionally, tasks can be grouped in collections, which can be shared with other users and modified by them if they have the right permissions. [Learn more](https://tracktask.eu.org/about)

## Where is it?
TrackTask is a browser-based web app that can be accessed at https://tracktask.eu.org. We've done our best to ensure support for all major web browsers, including ease of use and PWA installability on mobile devices.

## Things to consider:
> This project, while feature-complete, is **still in development**, some things may not work as expected. We're working on adding new features and improving existing infrastructure, but most of our development team has other commitments and a life outside of TrackTask, so we can't always devote our attention to issues/improvements.

> If you find something that you dislike and/or think could be better, **please don't just complain** about it. Sometimes we miss things, but most times we'd like to know _how_ we can improve things, so complaining about them won't get you (or us) anywhere.

> The code you see here is the product of **hundreds of hours of work and improvement**. We are very proud of how far we've come since development on TrackTask first started more than two years ago. The truth is, this project was created to satisfy a single person's need to keep track of school assignments, but it's grown to be much more; a worthwhile learning experience, a result that hopefully a few others will continue to find useful for many years to come.
