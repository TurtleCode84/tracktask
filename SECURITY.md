## Searching for Vulnerabilities
If you are a security researcher or intend to search for security issues in TrackTasks's codebase, application, or services, you are welcome to do so, provided that you do not cause our website and its services an undue amount of strain or stress. Only test vulnerabilities to the extend necessary to obtain enough information for the issue to be properly investigated and fixed, then report them immediately via the proper channels.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the event that you find a security vulnerability, do not abuse it or share details with anybody. Instead, please email the information to [`security@tracktask.eu.org`](mailto:security@tracktask.eu.org) using the following format. A member of our security team will reply to your email confirming that your report has been recieved within 24 hours. We may request additional information to help us understand and fix the issue.

### Vulnerability Report Format:
1. Please describe the vulnerability you encountered.
2. What browser and OS were you using (include versions)?
3. What events led up to you discovering the vulnerability? Please list steps that we could take to recreate the issue.
4. At what location (URL, section of the site, API endpoint, etc.) did you find the vulnerability?
5. If possible, please provide an approximate timestamp of when you discovered the vulnerability.
